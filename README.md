# BASIC RASTERIZER, UH...
## Building:

```
cd build
cmake .
make
./bruh
```

Models and textures should be in the "obj" folder and match the specific naming: "object name" + "diffuse/specular/tangent".  Output file will appear in the "output" folder. Thanks to @ssloy for the awesome tga parser and very useful information about 3d graphics!

Example:
